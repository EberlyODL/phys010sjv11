- M: Semiconductors are the raw materials for electronics. The actual machine is the transistor.
- S: I have heard the name before. What does it do?
- M: It is a valve.
- S: That's it?
- M: No, it can do more than that, and there are many versions of it, but the main usefulness of a transistor is that it is a tiny valve with no moving parts that can be made very, very tiny.
- S: Why do electronics need a valve?
- M: When you turn the super tiny transistor on, current goes through, while when you turn it off, it stops. We denote these two states by a 0 or a 1.
- S: Oh, I see, the transistor is where the 010010 bytes of computer come from!
- M: Exactly!

Here is a very well made video by Veritasium (who has many good videos on Youtube) about the transistor. There is not much to add to the video except to say don't worry about the last part about tunneling—we have not seen that yet.

The transistor is so important to everyday life that its electronic symbol can be found on the pavement in a Portuguese University.

The electronic symbol for the transistor shows the three basic components: the **source**, the **drain** and the **base**. Again the basic functioning is that by turning a voltage on the base, we turn the switch on and we let electrons go from the source to the drain.
