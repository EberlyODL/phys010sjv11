Summary: 
- An electron in a hydrogen atom is similar to an electron stuck in a box. We denote a bound electron to have negative total energy (K+U) while, if the electron has positive energy, it can escape.
- Quantization of energy in an atom means that only certain photons will be absorbed or emitted.
- These spectral lines are unique to each atom and are used to identify them.
- Quantization of energy explains insulators, which have a "band gap" where there is no electron at the right energy to conduct electricity.
- Semiconductors have a small band gap and, with the right push, they can be transformed from insulator to conductors.
- conductors have no band gap, and it is easy for electrons to free themselves from the atoms and move (in a current for example)
- The transistor is the most important machine in electronics. Its main use is as a valve. A small input voltage turns the valve on and lets a large current flow through.
