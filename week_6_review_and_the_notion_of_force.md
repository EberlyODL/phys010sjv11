## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor00: calculate the net forces from multiple forces in one dimension
* LOFor01: apply the idea that net forces are related to change in momentum.
* LOFor02: apply Newton’s third law in some examples.
