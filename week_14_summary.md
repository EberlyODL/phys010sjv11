Summary from Galileo to Galaxies:
- Free fall times are the same for different mass objects if drag can be neglected.
  - This is because mass also causes inertia and appears in the definition of momentum. So even though a more massive object feels a bigger gravitational force, it is also harder to make it move.
- Newton's law of gravitation states that there is a universal attraction between every object with a mass. This force is proportional to the mass of each object and inversely proportional to the distance squared.
  - Near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity is just $$F = mg$$ with $$g = 9.8 \; m/s^2$$. This is called weight. It should not be confused with mass. Weight is a force and the unit is Newton or pounds. Mass is in kg.
- Einstein's theory of General Relativity eventually supplanted Newton's theory. The difference between the two theories is very small in our daily life but Einstein's theory does predict a few qualitatively new phenomena 
  - It predicts that light should also be affected by gravity. This has been verified experimentally.
  - It predicts the existence of black holes. We now have pretty good evidence that there is a black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
  - It predicts gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime. These have been found experimentally using LIGO.
- Orbits can be explained with Newton's theory. The velocity to stay in orbit is

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

- where $$G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2$$ is Newton's constant. M is the mass of the planet you are orbiting around and r is the distance between the satellite/moon and the center of that planet.

- Our Universe contains: solar systems, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
- Doppler effect is the fact that the wavelength of a wave is shortened when a source is moving toward you while it is elongated when it is moving away.
  - We observe that almost all galaxies in the Universe are moving away from us (universe is expanding) because we see redshift (Doppler shift) in their spectral lines.
