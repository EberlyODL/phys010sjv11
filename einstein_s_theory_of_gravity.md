Newton's law of gravitation has been used for centuries and it works perfectly for any construction projects on our planet and it describes the movement in the cosmos quite well for most objects.

Newton's law of gravity is all you need if you want to send astronauts to the moon or if you want to study the rotation of stars in the galaxy.

But, as we saw earlier, Einstein demonstrated in 1905 that mass and energy are related and that there is a speed limit in the Universe (the speed of light). These two discoveries were inconsistent with Newton's theory of gravity but worked perfectly with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.

**To recap - here are the weird questions:**
- If mass and energy are related. Do massless photons gravitate? They have no mass but they do have energy. This is a big question.
- The Sun is 8 light-minutes away from us. This means that it takes 8 minutes for the light of the sun to reach the Earth. When you look at the Sun, you always see it as it was 8 minutes ago. If the Sun was to suddenly disappear it should take 8 minutes for us to feel the different gravitational force on Earth. In Newton's theory, there is no speed limit; Newton would predict that if the Sun suddenly disappears, you would feel it right away. Is that true?

So soon after inventing the **special theory of relativity**, Einstein realized that Newton's law of Gravity had to be changed to fit. It took him 10 years to figure out the solution. The new theory is called **General relativity** and it has the following features:

1. The force of gravity is now described as curvature of spacetime. Every object with energy curves spacetime, see Fig. "Curvature of Spacetime".
2. For most objects, the curvature of spacetime leads to the same law of attraction that Newton's discovered with some small corrections.
3. The curvature of spacetime affects light rays. So light is also affected by gravity.
4. If an object becomes very dense, it can capture light. This is called a black hole; see Fig. "Black Hole". 
5. The theory predicts that it should be possible to create waves of spacetime. If spacetime is changeable and dynamic and you can curve it, it should be possible to create ripples in spacetime that propagate. These are called **gravitational waves**. They are completely analogous to electromagnetic waves, which are ripples in the electric and magnetic field.
