Now that we have some background both the flow of electrons (current) and how electrons get their energy (batteries or power plants on the grid) we will focus a bit on how they are all connected, and what you can do with that current, specifically how it is used in the home. First, it is important to define the relationship between current and voltage in a circuit, and this is known as **Ohm's Law**, because it was defined by one Mr. Georg Ohm. He said that the amount of current that you get in a circuit depends on the voltage supplied divided by the amount of **resistance** to current in that circuit. 

<lrn-math>I= V/R</lrn-math>    

Resistance (which is the <lrn-math>R</lrn-math> in the equation above), is just that - something which slows down the current flow, usually by taking some of the electron's kinetic energy and turning it into something else.  (We will not use this equation for any calculations, only for our discussion about safety). Resistors can be boring (There is an electrical part called a _resistor_  it is used to help set the correct current or voltage in a circuit) or they can be more directly used - lights, computers, refrigerators - all take the electrical voltage and current supplied and use it for various purposes.


## Circuits 
What is a circuit anyway? The most simple definition is a Voltage source which is connected to a resistor, causing current to flow! Take a lightbulb connected to a battery, for example. The electrons start out with some initial energy which they get from the battery. Some of the kinetic energy the electrons has is converted to thermal energy (light bulbs are hot!) and, of course, some of it is converted to light as they flow through the lightbulb. The low energy electrons then return to the battery and get a boost of energy to repeat the cycle. But your house has more than 1 lightbulb and resistor...

There are generally two ways to wire multiple devices to a power source: 

- You could string them along in a line: toaster, microwave, refrigerator, etc. This is called **series** wiring. The problem with this in your house is that each appliance has to share the same voltage, divided up between them. This won't work though because each device says "120 V" (which is the voltage that comes out of the outlet). How do we assure each appliance gets 120 V?  

- Buildings are instead wired in **parallel**. In parallel each appliance gets is own connection to the voltage source (a.k.a. outlet), and they split up the current, allowing a smaller amount of current can go through each appliance at once.

Think of the queue's in a grocery store. There are many check-out counters that you can choose from - once you chose one then you purchase all your groceries at a single counter. This is parallel wiring in a store(!).

## Electricity and you

Sharing current in parallel is where circuit breakers come into play. Generally, homes are equipped with circuit breakers and fuses. These are there to prevent large currents from entering your home because they are a fire hazard, and dangerous to us humans. When appliances are wired in parallel, they share the current coming into the house (usually 200 Amps). Too many appliances = too much current, so you can "trip a breaker" - each small breaker is somewhere between 10 and 40 Amps.

- S: So how much current is too much? 
- M: Good question. Your body can handle about 1 mA (0.001 Amps) without a problem - it will give you a small shock, but about 0.1 A is fatal. Somewhere in between you can go into cardiac arrest because your heart works by electrical signals.

- S: but what about the tag on my hairdryer which says "Danger: Keep Away From Water" - I mean, I know that's a bad idea, but why?
- M: Well, when your skin is wet, it conducts electricity much easier, and its resistance decreases by about 100x,  which means even small amounts of current have potentially deadly outcomes. Tap water is also a rather good electrical conductor so even if the hairdryer is turned off, water could "short" the wiring and.. well, bad things can happen. 
- S: So, swimming pools and lightning?
- M: Yep, also bad, same reason.
