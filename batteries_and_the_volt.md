The current that you get by discharging a capacitor is quick and intense. In many situations, this is just what you need. For example, the flash on your camera is caused by the discharge of a capacitor and a battery would not work here since for a flash we need a large current and we need it fast. Each time you type on your keyboard you discharge a small capacitor.

But most of the time, we need a more constant source of current. Here comes the battery.

## Battery

Battery technology is a vast subject and one of active research nowadays. Most batteries are based on the following set-up.

You take two metals. One is a donor like Zinc (atomic symbol Zn) who wants to get rid of its electron while the other is a receiver like silver (Ag) who would like to get some extra electrons.

You can think of the situation as the energy diagram in the figure below. The electron in the zinc can, with a very small push, be transferred to the silver. On the way down, we can use their kinetic energy to light up our light bulbs.

But as it is, this battery won't last long since there will be an accumulation of negative charge on the silver. When the next electron comes in, all the electrons that accumulated before him will repulse it (see Fig 7.)

The solution is to use an electrolyte. We put a substance in between the zinc and silver where the atoms are ionized and the positive ions are free to move. The ions will move to cancel the charge and the current between the zinc and silver can then continue unimpeded for much longer (see Fig. 8)

The battery still has a finite lifetime since the electrolyte and the metals have finite number of ions and electrons. Also, the electrolyte is usually a dangerous acid, which can corrode the battery and this is why batteries require special care when disposed.

## Voltage

As you well know, different batteries have different voltage.

AAA, AA, C, D: 1.5 V  
9 V: 9V  
Lantern battery: 6 V  
Car battery: 12 V  
B battery: 18 V

Voltage is defined as Energy per unit of charge (Energy/charge) provided by the battery. Interestingly, The electron-volt(eV) is a unit for energy, which is just the charge e times 1 volt. 1 eV = <lrn-math>1.602 \times 10^{-19}</lrn-math> Joules, which is how much energy 1 electron gets from 1 Volt.

Roughly speaking, voltage is a measure of the “push” each charge gets from the battery. Batteries are also characterized by the maximum current they can output and by the total amount of charge or energy available.

### The Water Tower Analogy

Here is a good analogy for batteries (look at Fig. 9). You can think of a battery as a water tower where water is stored way up and flows down through a pipe whenever the appropriate gate is open.

In the water tower analogy, we have

1. The bigger the water tank, the bigger the battery reservoir of electrons. The longer it should last. Rectangular 9 V batteries or big D batteries (or a car battery) are all "big" batteries and they last longer. They have more electrons.
2. The size of the pipe determines how big of a current you can get. A car battery is 12 V, which is not that much but it can give rises to very large currents. It has a large pipe.
3. The height of the pipe is the voltage. It tells you how much energy each electron has. In order to operate certain devices, you need more or less energy per electron (voltage). This determines the voltage of the battery you would need.

Try the following exercise.
