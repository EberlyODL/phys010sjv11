Einstein's Explanation. 
------------------------

In 1905, Einstein had a very productive year.  It is often referred to as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers" target="_blank">Annus Mirabilis</a>. He was 26 years old and in that year, he published the following four papers:

1. **Photoelectric Effect**: "_On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light_" <a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf" target="_blank">Original</a> and <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=59468" target="_blank">Translated</a>
This is this week's subject of study. This is the work for which Einstein won the Nobel Prize.

2. **Brownian Motion**: _"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat._" 
<a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_549-560.pdf" target="_blank">Original</a> and 
<a href="http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf" target="_blank">Translated</a>
 This paper on Brownian motion was the final proof for atoms (revisit week 1) and started the field of physics known as statistical mechanics.
 
3. **Special Relativity**: "_On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,_" 
<a href="http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Zur_Elektrodynamik_bewegter_K%C3%B6rper" target="_blank">Original</a> and
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/" target="_blank">Translated</a>
 In this paper, Einstein extended the principle of relativity to include electrodynamics and showed that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.

4.  **Energy Mass Equivalence**: "_Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?_" 
<a href="http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf" target="_blank">Original</a> and
<a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/" target="_blank">Translated</a>
This was a direct consequence of the previous paper. He showed, among other things, that <lrn-math>E = mc^2</lrn-math>.

S: Wow, quite a year!

M: Yes, this is unparalleled. There have been many important discoveries in physics, but to have so many, in widely different subjects, in a single year is truly remarkable.

S: What was Einstein's solution to the experiment we just did?

## Light is Quantized

Einstein's proposition is that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets, small bunches - a **"quantum"**. He imagined that each "quantum" of light has an energy given by

<lrn-math>E = hf</lrn-math>

where f is the frequency and h is a number: Planck's constant. (It was introduced by Max Planck a couple years earlier.) Planck's constant is very important in this course. It is as important as it is small

<lrn-math>h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\cdot s</lrn-math>

The units are Joules times second or electron volt (1 eV = <lrn-math>1.602\times10^{-19}</lrn-math> J) times second. Einstein then supposed that when light interacts with electrons, it is an all-or-nothing business. The electrons can absorb only 1 quanta of light at a time (not 1.5 not 2). If light is absorbed in quanta, we say that it is _quantized_.

> Just a reminder that eV is just a (very small) unit of energy 1 eV = <lrn-math>1.602\times 10^{-19}</lrn-math> Joules

Einstein's equation <lrn-math>E = hf </lrn-math> is super simple and super important. I do expect you to be able to use it, so let's practice.

Let's see how this could work. Imagine that the electrons in a metal like zinc are in a potential well (like a pool) that is 3 eV (3 electron volts) in depth.

Video: The video below relates the "wave" properties of light to the photon energy to tie it all together.
