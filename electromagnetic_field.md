An electron creates an electric field around it. How can we get a magnetic field? The answer turns out to be: move the electron.

A current (moving electrons) going thru a wire creates a magnetic field (B) around it. The first observation of this phenomenon was done by Oersted in 1820. He observed that the needle of a compass laying on top of a wire moved slightly when a current was passing through. There seems to be a magnetic field (denoted B) around the wire but only when the current was on. With no current, there was no magnetic field.

An interesting configuration to set-up is to create a loop of wire in which the electrons are traveling in _a circle_. The loop of wire then behaves just like a small bar magnet with a North and South pole. In some sense the electrons are spinning around and the movement creates a magnetic field.

Compare the magnetic field created by a loop of current (a circular wire) (as shown in figure "loop") to the one of a bar magnet (shown in figure "bar magnet") - they look the same!

## Electromagnet

A small loop of current is not much of a magnet but if you have many loops of currents, you can create very powerful magnets. In fact, the most powerful magnets in the world are electromagnets. In the "five loops" figure below, you can see the magnetic field lines created by 5 loops of currents. Then below that you can see a "homemade electromagnet". Just take a wire, loop it many times around a nail, connect the wire to a battery (be careful, it will warm up!) and you will have a magnet- it will pick up paperclips (try it!)!

## Changing E field
The main message about magnetism that you should remember is that when an electron moves, the electric field E that it creates changes in time and a

**changing electric field E creates a magnetic field B.**

As it turns out, the reverse is also true. A **changing magnetic field B creates an electric field E.** This is the last key discovery about electricity. It was made by Michael Faraday and it really showed that electricity and magnetism are really linked together into one theory of _electromagnetism_. Here is a short demo about it
