This week was a short week about a complicated concept. 

* Waves can cancel and reinforce. (This is called interference.)

* When two waves with different shapes meet, you can just add the shapes directly on top of each other to figure out the combined pattern.

* You should be able to recognize the interference pattern of a double slit and explain the physics behind those images.

* Waves can be found in sound, light, and on a string

* Standing waves happen when they bounce back and forth within a tube (or on a string) - this is how musical instruments work. You should be able to identify the harmonic number of a standing wave.
