# The Electron

All the forces we have just discussed in examples are contact forces. The underlying cause and fundamental interaction behind contact forces is the electric force which we now turn to.

Electricity is almost always caused by the movement of a single particle: the electron.

## The Electron

As far as we know the electron has no substructure \(it is not made of anything else\). It is a fundamental particle of Nature and it has the following properties:

1. It has a mass of m\_e= 9.1 \times 10^{-31}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; kg
2. It has an electric charge of -1e

## Electric Charge

The electromagnetic force acts on every particle that is charged. As we saw in week \#1, the electron has one unit of negative electric charge. The proton has one unit of positive electric charge and the neutron is neutral and has zero electric charge. This means that the neutron does not feel the electric force while the electron and the proton do.

Experiments show that all charges that we see comes in integer units of an elementary charge _e_.

 e = 1.602\times10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Coulombs

where Coulombs is the unit for charge \(name after a physicist called Coulomb\). The electron really has a charge of -_e_ while the proton is +_e_ but we often just say -1 and +1 where the 1 means 1 unit of the elementary charge e.

## Static Electricity

In the ancient world, it was observed that when rubbed, amber would give off sparks and attract \(small\) items.

We now understand that for some material it is possible to take away electrons or add more electrons simply by rubbing. We don't have a good understanding of this but for some material, the electrons on the surface can be easily taken away while other material can easily steal electrons when you rub them.

This excess or lack of electrons in a material leads to static electricity. The electric force is a powerful force, much stronger than gravity; even a small excess or lack of electrons can create huge effects.

By doing experiments we determined the following properties of the electric force

1. Like charges repulse while opposite charges attract.
2. The electric force acts over long distance but gets weaker the farther we go.
3. The electric force can easily be more important than gravity and lift objects.

In the video below, you can see static electricity in real life. The person reacts very calmly \(and correctly\) when sparks from static electricity light the gas on fire!

> Note that she was touching her shirt. Some electrons got rub off on her hand \(either less or more electrons, we can't tell\). A spark then occurs just when she touches the nozzle. This is very rare but do be careful! If you have a lot of static electricity touch your hand on the car to discharge.
