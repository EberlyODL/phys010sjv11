# Week 7: Electric Forces

## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor03: predict whether the electric force will be attractive or repulsive in various situations
* LOFor04: estimate the magnitude and direction of the electric force given the electric field 
* LOTec01: distinguish the notion of current and voltage \(use the water tower analogy\).
* LOTec02: distinguish the functions and basic structures of a conductor, a capacitor and a battery. 
* LOTec08: explain current and voltage as they relate to electrical safety in the home.
