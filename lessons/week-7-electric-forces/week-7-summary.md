# Week 7 Summary

Electricity is one of the most common force of Nature and the underlying cause of all contact forces we feel and exerts.

* Electricity is an interaction between charged objects. The electron has negative charge -e and the proton has positive charge +e. Where e = 1.602\times10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Coulombs.
* Most of the time, the electrons are the particles moving in an electric current. The eV is a unit for energy, which is just the charge e times 1 volt. 1 eV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Joules.
* Each charged object generates an electric field everywhere in space.
* Given a picture of the electric field. You should be able to determine where the force is stronger and in which direction it is. The magnitude of the electric force is the charge times the magnitude of the electric field F = q E&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. If the charge is negative, the force will be in the opposite direction as the E field.
* You should know what a conductor, a capacitor, and a battery are. Understand the water tower analogy.
* You should have an understanding of household wiring \(why parallel\).
* You should know what a circuit breaker is for and about the hazards of electricity, and how they change when your resistance changes.
