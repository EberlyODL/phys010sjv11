# Color and Frequency

The discovery of the electromagnetic wave by James Clerk Maxwell in 1861 cannot be overstated as an achievement in humankind's search for answers. In one stroke, Maxwell finalized our understanding of the electromagnetic theory, set the stage for Einstein to discover relativity, and discovered that the speed of the electromagnetic wave was exactly the speed of light, leading to the obvious connection that light itself is an electromagnetic wave.

## One Wave with Many Names

Creating an electromagnetic wave is fairly easy, you just shake back and forth some electrons \(this is what an antenna does\). If you shake faster, you will generate a higher frequency wave.

In a radio antenna, we shake the electron at a frequency of 10^4&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Hz. This is 10,000 cycles per second! And this is the low frequency range! If you shake the electron with a frequency of 10^{12}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Hz, you will get infrared light while 10^{15}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Hz is the frequency of visible light.

For each corresponding frequency, we can find the corresponding wavelength \lambda = c/f&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. For radio, the wavelength is about 1 km while for visible light it is about 0.5\mu m&lt;/lrn-math&gt; \(where \mu m = 10^{-6}\; m&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\). Look at fig "spectrum" below to get an idea of the range of electromagnetic waves.

The figure show a range of frequency for electromagnetic waves. A small fraction of these frequencies is visible light. Other frequencies corresponds to waves which have different names like radio or microwave.

The important thing to remember is that all of these seemingly different waves are really just one and the same type: the electromagnetic \(E&M\) wave.

* M: Try this, Sophie. Look around you. In the room where you are standing is an E and B field extending everywhere. Think of it as a "mattress." On this "mattress," there are traveling ripples with short wavelength from all the light sources, there are also bigger wavelength ripples because your body and most other objects emit infrared light. There are radio \(and microwaves\) ripples from all the radio stations and cell phone towers.
* S: All of these waves are there together?
* M: Yepâ€”all traveling disturbances in the E & B field surrounding you.
* S: Wow, don't they interact with each other?
* M: They don't really interact, but they add and they interfere like other waves we have seen.
* S: And we detect only the ripples of visible light?
* M: Almost. We can feel infrared light if there is enough of it \(infrared heat lamp\). We don't see UV light, X-rays or gamma-rays, but we can get cancer from them \(which is one bad way of detecting that they are there!\).
* S: I guess by 'detecting,' I meant see with our eyes.
* M: Well then, it's true, we only see a very, very small fraction of all the E&M ripples out there. As you can you see in the fig "sensing". We are all very much blind and deaf!

## Color

Even in the small range of frequencies and wavelengths that we can detect, the visible spectrum, we can make further subdivision. Our eyes can detect the differences between a light wave of 600 nm versus 400 nm where \(1 nm = 1 nanometer = 10^{-9}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; m\) and these differences are interpreted in our brain as different colors. Below is the spectrum of visible light: \[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2183\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\]
