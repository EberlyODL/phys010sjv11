# Week 8: Electromagnetism & Light

## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LOFor05 relate a changing electric field to a magnetic field and vice-versa. 
* LOTec03 summarize the physical concepts behind an electromagnet, a generator and a transformer. 
* LOTec04 discuss why the electric grid uses AC current.
* LOPW08 describe light as an oscillating electric and magnetic field and list its properties. 
* LOPW09 employ the relation between intensity, power, and energy for a wave. 
* LOPW10 identify different types of electromagnetic waves
* LOPW11 describe radiative heat and the greenhouse effect. 

## News Article

* [Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/science/earth/what-to-make-of-a-climate-change-plateau.html?ref=greenhousegasemissions&_r=0&pagewanted=print)

There are obviously many interesting articles on this issue. \*\* This article is from 2013 and we seem to be very much out of the "warming plateau"
