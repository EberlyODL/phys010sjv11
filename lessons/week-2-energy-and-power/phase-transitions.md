# Phase Transitions

When you change the temperature of an object you can alter its state completely either melting it \(from solid to liquid, the reverse is freezing\), boiling it \(from liquid to gas, the reverse is condensing\) or ionizing it \(from gas to plasma\).

Note that during the phase transition \(from one state to another\), the temperature does not change. If you melt ice, the temperature will stay exactly at 0 ºC \(273 K or 32 ºF\) for as long as there is ice. Only when the ice is gone, will the water temperature start increasing. The energy pumped in the system during melting is used to break the chemical bonds between the water molecules.

Of all the state of matters, arguably gas is the one that changes the most when the temperature is increased.

The change in volume caused by changing temperature is easy to understand: if the molecules move faster, they take more space.

## Demo Warming Balls

In the demo below, I illustrate the change in volume that occurs when a metal ball is heated.
