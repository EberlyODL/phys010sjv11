# Week 1 Summary

The list below has some facts for a further level of detail. This list is not exhaustive please refer to your textbook and to the webpages before for the detailed information.

## Numbers and Units

* a nanometer is 10^{-9}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; m and atoms are about 0.1 nm in size.
* there are 10^{23}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; atoms in a mole and this is more than the numbers of stars in our galaxy!
* When you multiply two numbers in exponential notation you add the exponents. 10^{23} \times 10^{-10}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; gives 10^{23-10}= 10^{13}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.
* We will use SI units of meters, second and kilogram.

## Atomic Theory

* Atoms are small, numerous, ageless and move around constantly.
* Brownian motion refers to the random motion of large particles when atoms constantly hit them.

## Structure of Atoms

* Atoms are made of protons \(+ 1 electric charge\) and neutrons \(0 charge\) surrounded by electrons \(-1 negative charge\).
* Atoms are mostly just made of void or nothing.

## Elements

* Each element in the periodic table has an atomic number, which is the number of protons. Change the number of protons and you change the element.
