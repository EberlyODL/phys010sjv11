# Everything is a particle-wave

## Particles have wavelengths too

What is so special about light? How is it that light is not really a particle, not really a wave, but is, instead, some kind of dual quantity? Some strange "particle-wave."

Well, nothing is special about light. Every particle in the world is a "particle-wave."

* S: Really, wouldn't that be very noticeable?
* M: Well, first, we are talking about very small individual particles like electrons or protons. In large groups, the wave nature gets "washed out," and the reason for that is simple: there is always something continuously interacting within or with a very large object \(like a bus\). And whenever any object interacts it does so as a particle.
* S:. You mean that all the air molecules that are bouncin against me ensure that I behave like a particle?
* M: This is part of the reason. There is also the fact that the wave for massive objects has a very, very small wavelength. Lets talk about this in detail:

For light the relationship between a particle and the wave is explained by fact that the energy of the light-particle is directly related to the frequency of the light-wave.

E = hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

For particles with a mass, you need a more general relationship. To relate energy and wave. This equation shows the wavelength of a particle, was proposed by Louis de Broglie:

 \lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

This means that the wavelength is inversely related to its momentum. We call this the _de Broglie wavelength_.

For a massless particle like the photon we have that E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt; and you can check \(using that c = \lambda f&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\) that the de Broglie relationship ends up being E=hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. But for massive particles the momentum is  p= mv&lt;/lrn-math&gt; \(at "low" speed with respect to _c_\). The de Broglie wavelength is then

 \lambda = \frac{h}{mv}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

The important thing to understand here is that the more massive the object, the smaller the wavelength.

## Showing that the Electron is a "Particle Wave"

If you send a beam of electron through a small single slit, you will get a diffraction pattern that closely resembles what you get when you shine a laser through a small hole.

These dark and bright fringes are the same kind of interference that we use to prove that light was a wave!

## Contrast between an electron and the photon.

**1. Electrons**

The electron is a particle with mass, energy and momentum. There is a wave associated with the electron. We have no name for it, so we call it the "wavefunction of the electrons". The amplitude squared of that wave tells us the probability of finding the electrons in a region of space.

The relation between the wave and the particle is the de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelength of the wave \lambda&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle.

\lambda = h/p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

with _h_ being Planck's constant.

**2. Photons**

The photon is a particle with no mass but it still has energy and momentum related by E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. There is a wave associated with the photon. We know what that wave is. It is the electromagnetic wave. The amplitude squared of the E&M wave tells us the probability of finding the photons in a region of space.

The relation between the wave and the particle is either de Broglie relation which tell us that the wavelength of the wave \lambda&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle.

\lambda = h/p&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

with _h_ being Planck's constant. Or we can also use Einstein's relation

E= hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

These two are equivalent because we know that the E&M wave travels at the speed of light so we know that c=\lambda f&lt;/lrn-math&gt; while we also know from special relativity that the energy of the photon is E=pc&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.

M: So, back to the wavelength of you. If you weigh 60 kg and are moving at 1 m/s, your wavelength \lambda = h/mv&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is 6.62x10^{ -34}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;/\(60 kg \*1 m/s\) = 1.1x10^{-35}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; meters! which means the size of your wavelength is billions of times smaller than an atom. And that, is another reason why you are not all blurry like a wave.
