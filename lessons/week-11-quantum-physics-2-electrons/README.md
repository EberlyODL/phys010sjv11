# Week 11: Quantum Physics 2 - Electrons

## Learning Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to:

* LOQua05: apply quantum ideas to electrons with the de Broglie relationship. 
* LOQua06: summarize the uncertainty principle 
* LOQua07: explain how energy quantization for confined electrons arises
* LOQua11: describe what antimatter is
* LOQua12: explain what a particle collider is and what it can do.

## News Article

[Hint of new particles?](https://www.nature.com/news/physicists-excited-by-latest-lhc-anomaly-1.21865)

I choose this article because the media often jumps quickly on "hints" of new physics. Way too quickly in my opinion. Almost always, these hints turn out to be nothing. I am betting this particular discrepancy is probably just a fluke and I will wait until more data is collected and analyzed before getting excited.
