# Week 11 Summary

Summary:

* The de Broglie relationship tells us that particles behave like waves too. 

  -An electron has a wavefunction \psi&lt;/lrn-math&gt; associated with it. The intensity of the wavefunction tells us where we have more chances of finding the electron.

* When the electron is confined, its wavefunction shows standing wave patterns and the wavelength of the electron wavefunction is quantized. The rules for a particle in a box are the same as a standing wave.
* This leads \(via de Broglie's relationship\) to a quantization of the momentum and the energy.
* For an electron in a box, the energy levels go like the harmonic number squared.
* You should be able to describe uncertainty and know what antimatter is.
