# Week 5 Summary

* You should know some basic facts about the neutrino and about the Opera experiments.\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2135\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image**right**lightboxed\]
* Special relativity is like good old relativity but extended to all laws of physics not just mechanics.
* From that principle and the theory of electricity, it follows that the speed of light is always the same for any moving observers.
* Einstein worked consequences of this fact and they are very strange \(but true!\)
  * Time dilation: Time runs more slowly when you go fast \(in order to measure the same speed of light\)
  * Length Contraction: lengths get shorter when you go fast
  * Mass increases when you go fast \(from the book\)
  * Mass and energy are one and the same.
* The formula for energy is E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. If you have no momentum \(i.e., if you are not moving and p=0&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\) then this is just the famous formula E = mc^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.
* c is the symbol for the speed of light in vacuum.  c = 299,792,458 \; m/s&lt;/lrn-math&gt;
