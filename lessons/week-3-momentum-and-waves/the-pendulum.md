# The Pendulum

Before we study waves, we need to start by looking at the basic idea of an **oscillator**. You can get an oscillating behavior \(in time\) whenever there is a restoring force that wants to continuously bring back the system to equilibrium.

Oscillations are defined by two main quantities: the amplitude and the frequency. The amplitude is a measure of how large the displacement is from equilibrium while the frequency is the number of cycles per second. The unit of frequency is one over second 1/s&lt;/lrn-math&gt; or Hz \(Hertz\). We often use the period T=1/f&lt;/lrn-math&gt; which is just the inverse of the frequency. It has units of second\(s\) and it represents the time for one full oscillation. **Be careful, one full oscillation is one full back and forth.**

A mass oscillating \(vibrating\) on a spring has a regular frequency. The pendulum swinging back and forth in a grandfather clock is also an oscillator with a specific frequency.

The oscillatory behavior of a pendulum or a mass on a spring can be displayed in a graphical manner as shown below. Note the axis, time is the horizontal axis.

There is a lot of information that you need to be able to pick up from this graph:

* Amplitude x_m =\frac12 \(x_{max} â€“ x\_{min}\)&lt;/lrn-math&gt;
* Period T = time to repeat oscillation \(e.g., peak to peak\)
* Frequency f = 1/T. This is the number of oscillations per seconds. The units for frequency are Hertz.
