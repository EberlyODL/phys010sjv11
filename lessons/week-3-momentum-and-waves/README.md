# Week 3: Momentum and Waves

## Lesson Objectives

The objectives for this lesson are that by the end of the week you will be able to

* LONrgM08: calculate the momentum of a particle in one dimension with appropriate care for direction.
* LONrgM09: apply the principle of conservation of momentum to collisions and explosions in one dimension.
* LOPW02: note the similarities between various wave phenomena such as sound and light.
* LOPW03: employ correctly the relation between wavelength, frequency and speed of a wave.
* LOPW04: describe the basic features of the sound wave.
* LOPW05: understand how speed of sound can change and how this can lead to bending of wave.
