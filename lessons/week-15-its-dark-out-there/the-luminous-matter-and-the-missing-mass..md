# The Luminous Matter and the Missing Mass.

Luminous matter \(as opposed to dark matter\) is all the matter that we know and love. It is the matter that is charged under the electromagnetic force. It is electrons, protons, neutrons and their combination into atoms, etc...

Their electric charge allows them to create electromagnetic waves which is why they are luminous. Any emitter of electromagnetic waves is what we will refer to as luminous matter. So the Earth which emit in the infrared is luminous. Of course, the Earth is also luminous because it reflects the Sun's rays.

When we look at the luminous matter in the Universe, we find that it is mostly made of hydrogen \(75%\) and helium \(25%\): the two smallest and simplest atoms.

What about dark matter, why do we even think there is dark matter, and how do we know it is there if we can't see it? Dark matter, seems to have mass, but the fact that we don't see it means it does not produce electromagnetic waves. Therefore, it must be neutral under the electric force. It could be neutrons. It could be neutrinos. We have tried to explain the data with all the neutral matter particles that we know and it does not work. So dark matter is something new and undiscovered.

But first, what do we "see"? What is the evidence for the existence of dark matter?

## Indirect evidence for Dark matter.

The first evidence for dark matter came from galaxy rotation curves. We observe that the orbital speed of stars around all galaxies grows linearly the further from the center the star is; see Fig "Rotation Curve in Galaxy".

As you examined in the lab, usually the further you get from a mass, the slower your orbit. But in the galaxy rotation curve, it is as if the stars were orbiting inside of a gas of matter and as the stars orbit further away, there is **more** matter in the inner radius. This leads to stronger gravity which makes the stars orbit faster.

The strange thing is, we can't see any matter there \(checking for all frequencies of the electromagnetic wave\), we deduce that it must be some kind of dark matter \(matter we can't see\).

Here is another indirect evidence. The biggest objects in the Universe that are held together by the force of gravity are galaxy clusters.

Here is Abell 370 \(see Fig. " Abell 370"\), a giant galaxy cluster. Every smudges in that picture is a galaxy.

By looking at the Doppler shift of each galaxy, we can figure out at what speed they are moving. Part of that speed is related to the expansion of space, everything moves away from us, but another part is the actual local speed of the galaxy as seen by observer at rest within the galaxy cluster \(one galaxy moving around another one\).

We know from Newton's theory that in order for the galaxies in Abell 370 to be gravitationally bound \(orbiting\) they must be moving slowly enough.

There is an escape velocity for any object in orbit \(to let it escape orbit\). The escape velocity is

v\_{escape}^2 = \frac{2 G M}{r}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

This is \(up to a factor of two\) the same as the orbital velocity you saw last week. In this formula, r&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is the radial position of a galaxy you are looking at from the center of the galaxy cluster and M&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is the mass of the galaxy cluster inside the radius. For galaxy clusters like Abell 370, the escape velocity is of the order of 300 km/s given the mass we measure from looking at all gases and luminous objects. When we look at the data, we see galaxies with speeds all the way up to 1000 km/s. How can this be? With double the speed, galaxies have four times the kinetic energy and they should be able to easily escape - but they don't!

There are a couple of possibilities:

1. the equation above is wrong. Maybe our theory of gravity \(Newton or Einstein\) is wrong when applied in the cosmos?
2. we are just not measuring the mass right; i.e., there's more mass than the eye can see...

All evidences at the moment is that Einstein's theory of gravity is fine and good but we are missing mass because we can't see it. This mass that we don't see is the dark matter. \(Hence the name, it's dark because we can't see it.\) If there was more mass than we thought in Abell 370, then it would explain why the fast moving galaxies are stuck and don't just fly out.
