[Dark Energy and the Fate of the Universe](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28256534/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/mysterious-dark-energy-demystified/#.Ubc4oOvHRqM)

Since its discovery in 1998, we now have much corroborative evidence for dark energy. We now think that about 70% of the energy of the Universe is made of dark energy. About 25% is dark matter and the remaining 5% is us, the ordinary matter.

Sophie: This is incredible! 95% of the Universe is unknown dark stuff!

Marie: Yes, as we said. With more knowledge comes more ignorance!

## What is Dark energy?

We don't know yet but the best candidate we have for dark energy is the energy of vacuum. In the quantum world, small quantum fluctuations can happen all the time and they can have energy. This would be an energy of all space that would not dilute when space expands. It is therefore a good candidate for dark energy.

The problem is that the amount of dark energy that we see is a strange amount to have from quantum fluctuations alone. So physicists are still perplexed.

Maybe one day, we will have to invent a new theory to explain dark energy!
