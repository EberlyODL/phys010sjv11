# Week 4 Summary

This week was a short week about a complicated concept.

* Waves can cancel and reinforce. \(This is called interference.\)
* When two waves with different shapes meet, you can just add the shapes directly on top of each other to figure out the combined pattern.
* You should be able to recognize the interference pattern of a double slit and explain the physics behind those images.
* Waves can be found in sound, light, and on a string
* Standing waves happen when they bounce back and forth within a tube \(or on a string\) - this is how musical instruments work. You should be able to identify the harmonic number of a standing wave.
