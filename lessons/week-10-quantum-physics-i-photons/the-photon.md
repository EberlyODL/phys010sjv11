# The Photon

Last week, we discussed how light can be thought to be made of particles with energy

E = hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

where _h_ is known as Planck's constant. The frequency _f_ is the number of cycles per second that we would measure of a light wave. Note how strange this is. A property of the wave, the frequency, determines the energy of the light particle...

Planck's constant is a small number equal to h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\; J\; s&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. The units of _h_ are Joules times second. The particles of light are called photons.

## The Photon

The photon is a fundamental particle just like the electron. As far as we know it has no substructure \(it is not made of anything else\). It is a fundamental particle of nature and it has the following properties:

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2235\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\_\_left\]

1. It has a mass of 0; i.e., it is massless.
2. It has an electric charge of 0; i.e., it is \(electrically\) neutral.

To answer the next questions you may want to review energy in special relativity \(since the photon moves at the speed of light, relativity is necessary\) and electricity.

So light is made of particles called the photons. But as we have seen it is also an electromagnetic wave, which is a disturbance in the electromagnetic field. This was demonstrated in your first lab where you saw dark and bright fringes after light went through a double slit. These dark and bright fringes resulted from constructive and destructive interference which can only be explained using the principle of superposition that applies to waves!

So, how can we reconcile this dual nature of wave and particle?
