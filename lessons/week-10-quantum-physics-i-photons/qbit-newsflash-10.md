# Qbit, Newsflash 10

The double slit experiment is a complicated system to study quantum mechanics. In the double slit, we have to discuss the probability amplitude for all values of all the positions on the screen. There is really an infinite number of spots where the photon can go.

We can create a more simple system with only two possible positions for the photon. Like a coin with two sides, this is the simplest quantum system to analyze, manipulate and to do probability with. This is what we call the **Qbit**.

## Bits

A classical bit is a system that can be in two possible states. We call the first state 0 and the second 1.

A bit can transmit information. For example, in a time of war, a messenger could use a single bit to transmit this information \(the code need to be agreed upon beforehand\).

No message: No attack 0: The attackers are coming by sea 1: The attackers are coming by land.

We can share more complex messages \(and more information\) using a series of bits. A message would then look like 010100111000

> As we will see, bits are the basis for computing and the machine that actually stores the 0's and 1's in modern computers is the transistor. Interestingly, quantum mechanics is needed to understand how transistors work although the bits stored on transistors are normal bits, not quantum bits.

A quantum bit \(or Qbit\) is a quantum system that also has two states, 0 or 1, when you measure it. The new thing with the Qbit is that while there are only two outcomes to a measurement, the system can be in a superposition of the state 0 and 1 before you make the measurement. woah.

This superposition is why quantum computers may be much more powerful than classical computers.

Quantum computers may soon be a real possibility. Google, Microsoft and others are really working on this.
