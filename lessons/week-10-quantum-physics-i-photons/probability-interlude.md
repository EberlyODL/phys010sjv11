# Probability Interlude

To understand how photons behave, we need to take a pause and talk about probability.

Imagine the following situation: You are blindfolded and throwing darts at a dartboard as shown in the image below. You roughly know where the dartboard is and most of your shots are near the center. After a 100 shots, you get this pattern \(see fig\):

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2237\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\_\_left\]

## Defining Probability

Because 45 out of 100 throws ended up in region A, we could say that the chance of hitting region A is 45%. In general we can say that the probability of hitting region A is just the number of hits in A divided by the total.

P_A = \frac{N\_A}{N_{tot}}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

This probability is more and more accurate as the total number of throws gets really large. Similarly, we can define the probability of throwing in region B and C \(P_B&lt;/lrn-math&gt; and P\_C&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\) by counting the number of throws in region B or C \(N\_B&lt;/lrn-math&gt; or N\_C&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\) and dividing it by the total number of throws \(N_{TOT}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;\). The bigger the total number of throws, the more accurate the probability becomes.

## The Word OR

Let's say you want to know the probability that the dart was in region A **OR** region B. What do you do?

Since it does not matter which one, you just count all throws that landed in A or B.

P_{A\; or \; B} = \frac{N\_A + N\_B}{N_{tot}} = P\_A+P\_B&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

So, the probability of hitting A or B is the sum of the probability of hitting A and probability of hitting B. So in our example this would be 35% + 45% = 80%.

Note that the chance of hitting anything at all \(A OR B OR C\) should be 1 or 100%.

P\_A+P\_B+P\_C =1&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

> As we will see, quantum mechanics is special when it comes to adding probability because of interference which happens.

> Note: A probability must be a pure number \(no units\) between 0 \(impossible\) and 1 \(certain\). Often the number is represented as a percentage or as a fraction. For example a probability of p = 0.25 can be represented as 25% ,25/100 or as 1/4. One chance out of 4 is a probability p=0.25.
