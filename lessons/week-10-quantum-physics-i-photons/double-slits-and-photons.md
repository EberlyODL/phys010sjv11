# Double Slits and Photons

Let us revisit again the double slit experiment. You can see the basic setup in the figure below. We send light through slits separated by a small distance and the result is the interference pattern on the screen.

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2239\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\]

If we were to block one of the slit on the screen we would just a "smudge" of light \(with no bright/dark fringes\). The fact that light spread out is because the slits are very thin. The image below shows both "smudges" from each slit and the combined interference pattern.

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2241\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\]

From a wave point of view, the interference arises because of the small difference in the distance traveled between the two waves leading to constructive and destructive interference \(review week on waves if unsure, this is important!\)

## Double slit with photons.

Now we will turn on a very low power laser to send one single photon at a time through the double slit and we will use detectors everywhere on the screen to tell where each of the photons land. This can be done in actual experiments. We will keep sending photon after photon and record what the pattern look like. What we get is the image below \(this image was done with electrons but the idea remain the same\).

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2243\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\]

* S: Very strangeâ€¦
* M: It looks like the dartboard in the probability interlude page, doesn't it? It is actually impossible to predict exactly where the next photon will land, but we can use what we did with the dartboard and define probabilities to understand where each photon may go.

## Photon Probability

Let's say we want to know the probability that a photon will land on the screen in some small band of width \delta x&lt;/lrn-math&gt; near position _x_ \(see Fig. "Photon Prob"\). Just as we did for the dartboard, we send photons and count them. After sending a lot of photons, we can define the probability of landing in the rectangle of Fig. "Photon Prob" by counting how many photons landed there versus the total that we sent.

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2245\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\_\_left\]

And here is the main idea:

As you can see with your eyes, there are more photons where the light wave is more intense. So it looks like, **given the intensity of the electromagnetic wave, we can predict the probability of where the photons will go!**

We cannot predict where exactly each photon will go, but we can predict its most probable endpoint.

So good, there is a **link between the wave and the particle**. And the link is that:

> **The probability p of detecting a photon at a particular point x is directly proportional to the intensity of the light wave at that point.**
>
> P\(x\) \propto I\(x\) \propto A\(x\)^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;
>
> In the last part, we wrote that the intensity is the square of the amplitude of the wave A. For an electromagnetic wave, the amplitude will be given by the maximum electric field as we saw before.

* Try this JAVA simulation from PHET. After turning on the source and adding a double slit, you can change the display to show "hits." This way you can see the individual photons hitting the screen. Check out the single particles tab as well!
