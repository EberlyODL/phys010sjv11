# Photo-electric explained

We can now go back to explain the parts of the photoelectric experiments that were weird.

1. _**No electrons are ejected unless the frequency of the light is high enough \(so no electron for infrared but we do get for UV light\). Weird, why?**_

> because the electrons receive the energy of each photon E = hf. They can only get out of the metal if that energy is above the minimum energy cost to get out \(called work function\). So this makes sense now. **Explained!**

2.. _**The electrons are ejected as soon as the light is turned on. Weird, with a flame, it takes a while to warm up the electrons**._

> The energy of the electrons increase by a quantum amount as soon as they absorb a photon. This is not a slow buildup, this is instantaneous. **Explained!**

3.. The more intense the light is, the greater the number of ejected electrons. Normal, the bigger the flame, the more electrons there should be.

> This one was never weird. More intense light means more photons which will eject more electrons.

4.. _**The energy of the electrons does not increase with more intense light. Weird, you get more electrons but their individual energy does not change?**_

> The energy of the electrons will be the energy of the photons hf minus the energy cost to get out \(work function\). This does not depend on the intensity of light. **Explained!**

One powerful explanation from Einstein resolved all the paradoxes from that experiment. Of course, as often happens in physics, it led to many more questions about why the energy of light is quantized. In turn, these questions led to a new more fundamental theory of Nature called quantum mechanics which we will see next!
