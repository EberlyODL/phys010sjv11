# Ejecting electrons

The standard way to create the "cathode rays" \(the beam of electrons\) in a Crookes tube is to use a large battery with a large voltage between cathode and anode. Even though the cathode and anode don't touch, the voltage is so high that electrons jump out of the cathode and fly toward the anode.

Another way to create a current is to have zero \(or small\) voltage but to warm up the cathode. If you put the cathode under a flame, it will warm up and the kinetic energy of all the electrons inside of the cathode will slowly increase until some electrons moves so fast that they can escape the metal. Some of these electrons will land on the anode and we then detect an electric current.

If one was to setup this experiment, you would find the following \(very intuitive\) characteristics:

1. it takes some time under the flame before the first electrons are ejected. That is, there is a warming period. 
2. The hotter the cathode is the more electrons are ejected and the greater the current.
3. The energy of the electrons ejected are higher if the cathode was warmed to higher temperature.

This should all make sense from our learning about thermal energy. Now comes the interesting part. Imagine we decide that instead of warming with a flame, we will warm the cathode with an infrared light \(heat lamp\).

**To the surprise of everyone, no current is observed no matter how intense the heat lamp is!!** Even stranger is, if instead you use UV light, you will observe a current and it will have many special properties!

These puzzles \(and their solutions\) led us to better understand light and eventually led to the invention of quantum mechanics. This phenomenon is the _photoelectric effect_ : the subject of this week's lesson.

We will explain the experiment in more details but let us summarize the salient points right away. The setup for the photoelectric effect is shown in Fig. "Schematic of Photoelectric Effect". Note the similarities with the Crookes tube.

When we use the E&M wave instead of a flame to heat up we observe the following facts. \(The ones that are weird compared to a flame are _**in bold italics**_. The other one is as expected from our intuition with the flame.\)

1. _**No electrons are ejected unless the frequency of the light is high enough \(so no electron for infrared but we do get them for UV light\). Weird, why?**_
2. _**The electrons are ejected as soon as the light is turned on. Wierd: with a flame, it takes a while to warm up the electrons**._
3. The more intense the light is, the greater the number of ejected electrons. Normal, the bigger the flame, the more electrons there should be.
4. _**The energy of each electron does not increase with more intense light. Weird, you get more electrons but their individual energies do not increase?**_

A lot of strange things were observed. Einstein was the one to finally explain it. In fact, the photoelectric effect is what he received the Nobel prize of physics for! Let us go deeper here.
