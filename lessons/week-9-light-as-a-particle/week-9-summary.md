# Week 9 Summary

* The Crookes tube is a vacuum tube with an anode and a cathode. The green beam was later identified to be electrons by Thomson.
* Experiment with Crookes tube led to the discovery of X-rays.
* The total energy of an electron is its kinetic energy K plus its potential energy U.
* On a potential energy graph, the turning points are where the energy is all potential with no kinetic \(speed=0\).
* Solar cell technology is based on the photovoltaic \(or photoelectric, essentially the same thing\) effect in which light is absorbed by electrons which then create a current.
* The photoelectric effect is a famous experiment that first proved that light was a particle.
* The setup of that experiment is the following:
  * You shine light on a target on a cathode. Electrons are ejected and move toward an anode. \(the whole thing is inside of a vacuum tube\). This create a current. We can stop the current by applying a voltage in the opposite direction. We can also change the frequency of the incident light and the intensity to see what happens.

* The stopping potential is the value in volt that will stop the electrons.

K = e V\_{stop}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

* The two unusual things about the photoelectric effect are that
  1. There is a threshold of frequency before any current starts
  2. The stopping potential is independent of the intensity of the light.
* Einstein's explanation was that light is made of particle \(photons\). The energy of each particle is related to the frequency of the wave by the simple relationship \(which you need to be able to use\).

E = hf &lt;/lrn-math&gt;

with

h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\; s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\;s&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

\(do not memorize\)

* You should understand how Einstein's idea successfully explained the photoelectric effect.
