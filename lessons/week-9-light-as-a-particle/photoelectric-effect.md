# Photoelectric Effect

Let us practice the use of the potential energy graph.

For a little more practice and review of Kinetic Energy try this question:

The energy graph will be immensely useful as we talk about the behavior of electrons and protons in the next three weeks.

The photoelectric effect on its own is not so mysterious. You should think of a conductor as a container within which the electrons are trapped. A good analogy would be a swimming pool and the electrons are drops of water. If you jump in the swimming pool and start making waves, drops of water will be thrown away. Analogously, when we shine light on a metal, all the electrons inside are excited and some are ejected. This is the simple physics behind the photoelectric effect, and you may ask what the fuss is all about.

## The Stopping Potential

When light is shone on a target, the photoelectrons are ejected from the target on the cathode with some kinetic energy. The tube is empty of air; therefore, the electrons just fly from the cathode to the anode with some kinetic energy K creating a current. We can stop the current by turning on an electric potential - we can use that to figure out _how much_ kinetic energy the electrons have. \[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2217\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\_\_left\]

_**\*\* Watch out for name confusion:**_

1. Electrical potential is V with units of Volt.
2. Electrical potential energy is U with units of Joules.

As you can remember from the week on electricity, a **Volt is energy per unit of charge** and so the relation between V and U is just

U = q V&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

They are closely related as you can see.

By turning a potential \(a Voltage\), it is as if we were setting up a slope, as in Fig. "Potential energy between cathode and anode". The electrons are ejected out of the cathode with some kinetic energy but they will only reach the top if they have enough kinetic energy.

\[ciscode\|rev=1\|tool=elmsmedia\|item=2219\|entity\_type=node\|render=display\_mode\|display\_mode=image\_\_right\]

In the experiment, we can adjust the potential on the battery just to the point where there is no more current. When current = zero, we have found the spot where kinetic energy is equal to potential energy on top of the slope! We call this critical value of voltage, **the stopping potential.**

K = U = e V\_{stop}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

where e is the charge of the electron. The stopping potential is the minimum voltage needed to stop the electrons \(higher voltage just make the electron stop and turn earlier than the anode\).

> The stopping potential is the minimum energy to stop and it thus equal to kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.

## A new unit of energy: the electron-volt.

Electric Potential is energy per charge. This means that charge times potential is an energy. \(Electric Potential is sometimes just called Voltage - it is the same thing!\)

We define a new unit of energy, the electron volt eV, to be the charge of an electron 1.602\times 10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; C times one volt

1 eV = 1.602\times 10^{-19}\;\rm{C}\times\;1;\rm{Volt} = 1.602\times 10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Joules

> This unit of energy is much smaller than Joules and more practical for talking about the electrons and atoms. We will use it often.
