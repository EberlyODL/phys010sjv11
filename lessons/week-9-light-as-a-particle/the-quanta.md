# The Quanta

## Einstein's Explanation.

In 1905, Einstein had a very productive year. It is often referred to as the [Annus Mirabilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers). He was 26 years old and in that year, he published the following four papers:

1. **Photoelectric Effect**: "_On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light_" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf) and [Translated](https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=59468) This is this week's subject of study. This is the work for which Einstein won the Nobel Prize.
2. **Brownian Motion**: _"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat._" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_549-560.pdf) and [Translated](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf) This paper on Brownian motion was the final proof for atoms \(revisit week 1\) and started the field of physics known as statistical mechanics.
3. **Special Relativity**: "_On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,_" [Original](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Zur_Elektrodynamik_bewegter_K%C3%B6rper) and [Translated](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/) In this paper, Einstein extended the principle of relativity to include electrodynamics and showed that the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.
4. **Energy Mass Equivalence**: "_Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?_" [Original](http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_18_639-641.pdf) and [Translated](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/) This was a direct consequence of the previous paper. He showed, among other things, that E = mc^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;.

S: Wow, quite a year!

M: Yes, this is unparalleled. There have been many important discoveries in physics, but to have so many, in widely different subjects, in a single year is truly remarkable.

S: What was Einstein's solution to the experiment we just did?

## Light is Quantized

Einstein's proposition is that light is not really a continuous wave but, instead, arrives in small packets, small bunches - a **"quantum"**. He imagined that each "quantum" of light has an energy given by

E = hf&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

where f is the frequency and h is a number: Planck's constant. \(It was introduced by Max Planck a couple years earlier.\) Planck's constant is very important in this course. It is as important as it is small

h = 6.63\times 10^{-34}\;J\cdot s = 4.14\times 10^{-15} \rm{eV}\cdot s&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

The units are Joules times second or electron volt \(1 eV = 1.602\times10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; J\) times second. Einstein then supposed that when light interacts with electrons, it is an all-or-nothing business. The electrons can absorb only 1 quanta of light at a time \(not 1.5 not 2\). If light is absorbed in quanta, we say that it is _quantized_.

> Just a reminder that eV is just a \(very small\) unit of energy 1 eV = 1.602\times 10^{-19}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Joules

Einstein's equation E = hf &lt;/lrn-math&gt; is super simple and super important. I do expect you to be able to use it, so let's practice.

Let's see how this could work. Imagine that the electrons in a metal like zinc are in a potential well \(like a pool\) that is 3 eV \(3 electron volts\) in depth.
