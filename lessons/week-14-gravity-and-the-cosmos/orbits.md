# Orbits!

Orbits are the subject of your lab this week. To study orbits, we do not need to use Einstein's theory of gravity. Newton's theory of universal attraction is perfectly good enough.

If you launch a projectile on the surface of the Earth, you get a nice parabolic motion. An orbit is just a projectile that is unable to "land" back on the planet, because the Earth is curving away from it; see Fig. "Orbits".

In order to stay in orbit, the object needs move fast. The closer the orbit to the surface of the planet, the faster you need to go. The orbital velocity can be figured out using Newton's law of gravity. The formula is the following

v^2 = \frac{G M}{r}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

where G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is Newton's constant. M is the mass of the planet you are orbiting around and r is the distance between the satellite/moon and the center of that planet.

You do not need to memorize the formula, but you do need to understand it. The main point is that the closer the orbit is \(smaller r\) the faster you need to move!

Instead of velocity, we often like to talk about period \(T\). The period tells us how long it takes the satellite/moon to go around once \(time for one orbit\). The orbiting period is just the distance traveled in one turn divided by the speed.

T = 2\pi r/v&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

## Low Earth Orbits \(LEO\)

In order to be in orbit for a long time, you need to get out of the atmosphere to eliminate drag. The lowest orbits are about hundred miles high just where the atmosphere ends. For example, the International Space Station is in low Earth orbit, it is about 400 km high. The Hubble space telescope is also in LEO.

The velocity for LEO is 8 km/s \(of 5 miles/s\), which is about 18,000 mph \(miles per hour\)!! At this speed, LEO satellites go around the Earth in only 90 minutes!

## Geosynchronous Orbits

There is a special orbit where the satellites travel slowly enough that their period is 24 hours, the same as the rotation of the Earth. This happens at a distance of about 22,000 miles above the surface of the Earth. If you align the orbit to be centered with the equator, this result in a satellite which is stationary with respect to a point on the Earth. These satellites are always in the same place in the sky. For example, you could put your satellite such that it is always visible for people in the United States.

The geosynchronous orbit is where the great majority of communication satellites are. In fact, it is getting crowded on this orbit and spots on are very prized!

In the movie below, you can see most of the known \(non-military\) satellites. Most of them are on the geosynchronous orbit. The movie starts really slow, you may want to skip to 30 seconds into the movie.
