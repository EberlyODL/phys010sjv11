## Looking for gravitational waves

Gravitational waves were finally detected directly in 2015. Almost a century after Einstein's theory of General Relativity! Before the LIGO discovery we only had very good **indirect evidence**, and broad consensus among physicists that these waves were out there. Gravitational waves are generated by binary systems of very heavy stars or even black holes that are spinning until they coalesce in a explosive event; see Fig. "Ripples in Spacetime".

In the couple of turns just before the collision, the pair of stars or black holes emit large amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves. These waves are ripples in spacetime. Our best hope to detect them is to have a very precise measurement of a particular distance and to see whether this "distance meter" changes or fluctuates as a gravitational wave pass by. This is what a gravitational wave would do. It would change the length of a meter very, very slightly.

The LIGO experiment has two detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana and the other one at the Hanford Observatory near Richland, Washington. The both have two long " measurement arms" with powerful and precise lasers going through each arm. By looking at destructive and constructive interference of the lasers going down those arms, the LIGO scientists are able to measure the distance of each arm very precisely \(and look for changes!\).
