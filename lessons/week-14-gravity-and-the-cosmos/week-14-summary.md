# Week 14 Summary

Summary from Galileo to Galaxies:

* Free fall times are the same for different mass objects if drag can be neglected.
  * This is because mass also causes inertia and appears in the definition of momentum. So even though a more massive object feels a bigger gravitational force, it is also harder to make it move.
* Newton's law of gravitation states that there is a universal attraction between every object with a mass. This force is proportional to the mass of each object and inversely proportional to the distance squared.
  * Near the surface of the Earth, the force of gravity is just F = mg&lt;/lrn-math&gt; with g = 9.8 \; m/s^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt;. This is called weight. It should not be confused with mass. Weight is a force and the unit is Newton or pounds. Mass is in kg.
* Einstein's theory of General Relativity eventually supplanted Newton's theory. The difference between the two theories is very small in our daily life but Einstein's theory does predict a few qualitatively new phenomena 
  * It predicts that light should also be affected by gravity. This has been verified experimentally.
  * It predicts the existence of black holes. We now have pretty good evidence that there is a black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
  * It predicts gravitational waves: ripples in spacetime. These have been found experimentally using LIGO.
* Orbits can be explained with Newton's theory. The velocity to stay in orbit is

v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}&lt;/lrn-math&gt;

* where G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\; N\;m^2/kg^2&lt;/lrn-math&gt; is Newton's constant. M is the mass of the planet you are orbiting around and r is the distance between the satellite/moon and the center of that planet.
* Our Universe contains: solar systems, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
* Doppler effect is the fact that the wavelength of a wave is shortened when a source is moving toward you while it is elongated when it is moving away.
  * We observe that almost all galaxies in the Universe are moving away from us \(universe is expanding\) because we see redshift \(Doppler shift\) in their spectral lines.
