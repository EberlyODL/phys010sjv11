# Newsflash 13

The news article for this week is about the 2010 nuclear meltdown in Japan. [Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown 2010](http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2011/03/15/15climatewire-new-explosion-rocks-fukushima-nuclear-plant-19902.html?pagewanted=print)

While I chose an article related to a nuclear meltdown, I want to remind you that nuclear reactors are still to this day one of the safest forms of power plants. Coal plants cause cancer, too, while Hydroelectric dams do a lot of damage to the environment! Each source of energy has its advantages and disadvantages.
