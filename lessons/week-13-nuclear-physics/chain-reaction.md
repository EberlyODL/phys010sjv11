# Chain Reaction

You would think that in order to operate a nuclear reactor, you would need a constant supply of fresh neutrons to break the Uranium.

This is not true, and it is both good and bad. It is not true because in every fission, three neutrons are released that can then go on to hit another Uranium 235 atom - it is a self-sustaining chain reaction.

This is good because, the nuclear reaction is potentially self-sustaining. It is bad because we can lose control of the reaction and end up with a nuclear meltdown.

Here is an illustration of a chain reaction with a radioactive mousetrap in the demo below.
