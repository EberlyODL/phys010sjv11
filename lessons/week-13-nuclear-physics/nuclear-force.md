# Nuclear Force

All 'particles' are represented by a wavefunction whose intensity tells us the probability of finding that particle at a particular location.

If the particle is contained in a small area. The wavefunction must be a standing wave. For such waves, only some quantized set of wavelengths \(or energies\) are allowed. The cloud model of the atom \(see Fig. "Cloud Model Helium Atom"\) shows the wavefunction of the electron.

## Nucleus

The most important properties of atoms have to do with their electrons, and this is what chemistry is about. We have seen that the quantization of energy of those electrons leads to atomic spectra, to band-gap in solids, and, ultimately, to all of the high tech in our world.

One important aspect of an atom that we have not yet studied is the nucleus. We have treated the nucleus as a point, even though it really should be described by a wave just like the electron.

I remind you that the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons \(these are the "nucleons"\). The protons repulse each other because of electricity. In order to overcome that repulsion, there must be an attractive force holding them in the nucleus. This is the **nuclear force** and it acts equally between protons and neutrons.

The attractive nuclear force between nuclei has the following properties.

* It is short range. It drops to zero very quickly outside of the nucleus.
* The nuclear force is the same between protons and neutrons but because protons repulse each other due to the electric force, the combination of nuclear + electric force makes the attraction between protons slightly weaker than between neutrons. 

## Radiation

The protons/neutrons inside of the nucleus are very much like the electrons inside the atom. You can think of them as particles that are bound inside of a potential energy well \(inside of a box\).

So, just like an atom can emit light from electrons undergoing transitions between different energy levels, a nucleus can also emit radiation. Usually the radiation emitted from the nucleus is much more energetic and harmful. The three main dangerous nuclear rays are shown in Fig "Nuclear Radiation".

1. **Alpha radiation:** This is really a helium atom without any electrons \(it is doubly ionized\).
2. **Beta radiation:** This is just an electron \(or sometimes a positron, the anti-particle\). _We will not discuss this type of radiation in this class._ It happens when a neutron decides to transform into a proton. This transformation is possible \(although rare\) and in the process, an electron is ejected. We call this a beta-ray.
3. **Gamma radiation**. This is a photon \(light\) of wavelength of about 10^{-12}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; m or frequency of about 10^{20}&lt;/lrn-math&gt; Hz. So this is a highly energetic photon.
