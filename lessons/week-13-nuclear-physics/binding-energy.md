# Binding Energy

The nuclear force acts very much like a box. It is a very strong force at the outskirts of the nucleus that keeps the nucleons tight together, but inside the nucleus, protons and neutrons can move pretty freely \(electric force mixes things up but not that much\). In this class we will **model** the nucleus to be a potential energy box like in Fig "Box Model for Nucleus".

Nuclear physicists call this the **Shell Model** and, while it is rudimentary, it does capture most of the important phenomena about nuclear physics.

> In the shell model, we imagine that protons are neutrons free to roam around inside the nucleus but hard to get out. Note that this very different than the artistic representation often depicted where protons and neutrons are stuck together. Second, the combination of 2 protons and 2 neutrons \(called and alpha particle\) turns out to be very stable and we can model the nucleus as having such bound states inside of it.

## Average Binding Energy per Nucleon

The model we have for the nucleus is a box. Think of it as a swimming pool. With enough energy we can shake the water in the pool such that some water escapes out. Same thing with the nucleusâ€”we can give it enough energy to shake out protons, neutrons or entire helium atoms \(alpha particles\).

We define the average binding energy as the average energy we need to shake the nucleus to get some protons or neutrons out of it. **The higher the binding energy**, the harder it is to take nucleons out and **the more stable** the atom is \(see Fig "Average Binding Energy".

We have experimentally measured the average binding energy for nucleons in each element of the periodic table and the result is shown in Fig. "All Average Binding Energies".

S: I have a question here. M: Go ahead I will take it. S: What's up with the spike for Helium? M: Very good. Helium is a particularly stable atom for the number of nuclei it has. This is why in the nucleus, the protons and neutrons like to group themselves in bunches of helium nuclei. We call those **bunches of 4, the alpha particle**. S: is that it?. Your answer is that it just happens to be that way. M: Yes. This configuration of 2 protons and 2 neutrons just happens to be particularly stable.
