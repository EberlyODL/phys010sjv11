We have seen how the energy levels of the electron are quantified inside of an atom. Imagine you have hydrogen in gas form where all the atoms are in their ground state. You will need 13.6 eV per hydrogen atom to free all the electrons. Once the electrons are free, you will have a hydrogen plasma and it will conduct electricity (since the electrons are free to move).

This idea of an energy gap, often called **band gap**, is what differentiates conductors from semiconductors from insulators. Fig. "Band Gap" shows the allowed band of energy for electrons in a solid material (usually crystals).

In the figure, the valence band refers to electrons that are bound to the atoms while the conduction band refers to electrons that are free to move everywhere in the crystal.
#### Insulators
The fact that there is a band gap is what allows for insulators to exist and it follows from quantization of energy. Insulators are then materials in which electrons are tightly bound to their atoms and therefore they don't allow currents (of electrons) to flow.

#### Conductors
For conductors, the gap between the energy of the free electrons compared to the stuck electrons is zero. This means the electrons can be stuck or freely moving at the same energy. The freely moving electrons is what make a metal a conductor of electricity.

#### Semiconductors
Semiconductors are materials where the band gap is small. By slightly exciting the material, we can switch a semiconductor from being an insulator to being a conductor.
