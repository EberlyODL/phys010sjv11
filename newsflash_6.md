The Greenhouse effect is the warming of the atmosphere due to the way the gases in the atmosphere balance the earth’s and the sun’s radiation. In a nutshell, the greenhouse effect has the following three steps:

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2185|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image]

- Solar radiation enters atmosphere as short wavelenghts (high energy).
- Earth absorbs these short waves but reemits long wavelenghts (infrared).
- The long waves get absorbed by the greenhouse gases (mostly CO<sub>2</sub> and water) and come back.

The net effect is analogous to a car in the parking lot. The layer of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is like the windshield. It keeps the Earth warm.

- S: Really? Water is a greenhouse gas? So boiling water is polluting?
- M: Yes, I guess it is. . . but the thing with water is that it falls back down. The concentration of water vapor--unlike the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>--does not seem to be increasing non-stop.

## Global Warming

Global warming is an important issue and the whole Earth climate is a complicated system. Nevertheless, the basic science behind global warming is simple physics—it is just the greenhouse effect.

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily over the last 50 years (see the fig).

Over the same 50 years the average temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1 degree C.

Now, as we said above, the climate is a very complicated system subject to random fluctuations and variations. Just because the two graphs above look alike does not mean that one is the cause of the other.

Nevertheless many scientists have studied the question. The consensus from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is that

> _It is 90% likely that humans are responsible for at least some or possibly most of the observed global warming of the last 50 years._

This is a surprisingly low-key and restrained position. Most people think scientists are alarmist, but they tend to be very careful in stating their positions.

## Warming Plateau

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2190|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left]

The article that you read referred to a warming plateau. This is the fact that from 2000 to 2010 the rise in temperature slowed down (it now seems to be back up).

Many critics of global warming use this warming plateau to show that the other side is wrong. This is an example _of cherry-picking data_. Cherry picking refers to the act of choosing data that you like and ignoring the data that you don't like. This is an unethical scientific behavior.

It is already a very hard exercise with many years of work and analysis by a whole community of scientists to reach the conclusion that global warming is real.

You may find someone who just looked at one part of a graph (the temperature graph over the last 10-15 years) and then decided that this means that scientists are wrong, but this is not good science.

Scientists that work on global warming know about the warming plateau. They don't cherry pick data; the warming plateau is included in their analysis. After including all the data (including years where temperature was stable or going down), climate scientists have reached the conclusion that global warming is real and that

> _It is 90% likely that humans are responsible for at least some or possibly most of the observed global warming of the last 50 years._

- As an optional reading, if you want to learn more about global warming, see Chap. 10 of your book. It has a very lucid discussion on the subject.
