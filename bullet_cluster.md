One of the best and most beautiful evidence that we have for dark matter is the bullet cluster. This is a very special galaxy cluster through a gravitational lensing analysis that was done about 10 years ago it is very revealing about dark matter.

Here is the Bullet cluster as seen with the Hubble space telescope (i.e. detecting visible light -- see Fig. "Bullet cluster: visible light").

Here is what the cluster looks like in X rays (superposed on top of the optical image -- see Fig. "Bullet cluster: x-rays +visible"). The X-ray image shows the presence of gas in the galaxy that is impossible to see in the visible spectrum. The gas is very hot and the electrons are moving really fast which is why the gas emits X rays. As you can see in Fig. "Bullet cluster: x-rays +visible", the gas on the right has the form of a shock wave. This is where the name "Bullet cluster" comes from.

Finally, Fig. "Bullet cluster: lensing mass" shows where all the mass must be as determined by gravitational lensing.

Putting it all together, we get this amazing image that clearly shows two different clusters (see Fig. "Bullet cluster: combined"). In the image we can see the galaxies and the gases. This is clearly a collision between two huge galaxy clusters but most of the mass found by gravitational lensing just seemed to have passed through each other. The dark matter and the gas are separated!

We think that what happened is that the two galaxy clusters collided, the gas interacted but the dark matter did not. Because this image clearly shows that the majority of the mass of the objects is separated from the gas, it provide evidence for a new type of mass that we can't see, this must be the dark matter. 

Remember that we don't see dark matter. The blue is a fake color where we inferred the dark matter must be. We know it must be there because it forces the galaxies and the gas to orbit around it because it bends the surrounding light. That is we detect dark matter because of what it does via gravity.
